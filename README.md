### <h1> Hi there, I'm Raab! ðŸ‘‹ </h1>
ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her

Welcome to my GitHub student profile, where you can explore my first-year projects. Repositories for projects from the second year onward are private due to sensitive company data.

I'm currently a computer science student. When I'm not developing and coding, you can find me watching YouTube, Sports or reading a book.
âš¡ Fun fact: I love listening to music
